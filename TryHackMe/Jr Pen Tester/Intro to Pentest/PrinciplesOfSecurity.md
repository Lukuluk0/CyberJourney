# **Principles of Security**

---

## **CIA Triad**

Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (**CIA**)

### **Confidentiality**

This element is the protection of data from unauthorized access and misuse.

### **Integrity**

The CIA triad element of integrity is the condition where information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorized changes are made.

### **Availability**

In order for data to be useful, it must be available and accessible by the user.

## **Privileges**

It is vital to administrate and correctly define the various levels of access to an information technology system individuals require.

The levels of access given to individuals are determined on two primary factors:

- The individual's role/function within the organisation
- The sensitivity of the information being stored on the system

Privileged Identity Management (**PIM**): PIM is used to translate a user's role within an organisation into an access role on a system

Privileged Access Management (**PAM**): PAM is the management of the privileges a system's access role has, amongst other things.

## **Threat Modelling & Incident Response**

Threat modelling is the process of reviewing, improving, and testing the security protocols in place in an organisation's information technology infrastructure and services.

The principles all return to:

1. Preparation
2. Identification
3. Mitigations
4. Review

An effective threat model includes:

1. Threat intelligence
2. Asset identification
3. Mitigation capabilities
4. Risk assessment

There are frameworks such as **STRIDE** and **PASTA**

STRIDE:

| Principe               | Description                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spoofing               | Requires you to authenticate requests and users accessing a system. Spoofing involves a malicious party falsely identifying itself as another. |
| Tampering              | Data that is accessed must be kept integral and accurate.                                                                                      |
| Repudiation            | The use of services such as logging of activity for a system or application to track.                                                          |
| Information Disclosure | Only show information relevant to the owner is shown.                                                                                          |
| Denial of Service      | Measures in place so that abuse of the application/service won't result in bringing the whole system down                                      |
| Elevation of Privilege | A user was able to escalate their authorization to that of a higher level i.e. an administrator                                                |

Incidents are classified using a rating of urgency and impact.

An incident is responded to by a Computer Security Incident Response Team (**CSIRT**)

To successfully solve an incident, these steps are often referred to as the six phases of Incident Response that takes place:

| Action          | Description                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Preparation     | Do we have the resources and plans in place to deal with the security incident?                      |
| Identification  | Has the threat and the threat actor been correctly identified in order for us to respond to?         |
| Containment     | Can the threat/security incident be contained to prevent other systems or users from being impacted? |
| Eradication     | Remove the active threat.                                                                            |
| Recovery        | Perform a full review of the impacted systems to return to business as usual operations.             |
| Lessons Learned | What can be learnt from the incident?                                                                |
