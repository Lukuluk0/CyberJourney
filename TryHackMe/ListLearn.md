[List of all the Ports from 1 to 1024](http://www.vmaxx.net/techinfo/ports.htm)

| Protocol                                   | Port Number | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File Transfer Protocol (FTP)               | 21          | This protocol is used by a file-sharing application built on a client-server model, meaning you can download files from a central location.                |
| Secure Shell (SSH)                         | 22          | This protocol is used to securely login to systems via a text-based interface for management.                                                              |
| HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)         | 80          | This protocol powers the World Wide Web (WWW)! Your browser uses this to download text, images and videos of web pages.                                    |
| HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) | 443         | This protocol does the exact same as above; however, securely using encryption.                                                                            |
| Server Message Block (SMB)                 | 445         | This protocol is similar to the File Transfer Protocol (FTP); however, as well as files, SMB allows you to share devices like printers.                    |
| Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)              | 3389        | This protocol is a secure means of logging in to a system using a visual desktop interface (as opposed to the text-based limitations of the SSH protocol). |
