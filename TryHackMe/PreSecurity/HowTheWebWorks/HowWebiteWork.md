# **How Websites Work**s

---

## **Introduction**

When you visit a website, your browser  makes a request, the web server is just a dedicated computer somewhere else in the world that handles your requests.

There are two major components that make up a website:

1. Front End (Client-Side) - the way your browser renders a website.
2. Back End (Server-Side) - a server that processes your request and returns a response.

## **HTML**

Websites are primarily created using:

- HTML, to build websites and define their structure
- CSS, to make websites look pretty by adding styling options
- JavaScript, implement complex features on pages using interactivity

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the language websites are written in.

## **Javascript**

JavaScript (JS) is one of the most popular coding languages in the world and allows pages to become interactive.

JS can dynamically update the page in real-time, giving functionality to change the style of a button when a particular event on the page occurs.

## **Sensitive Data Exposure**

Sensitive Data Exposure occurs when a website doesn't properly protect (or remove) sensitive clear-text information to the end-user.

## **HTML Injection**

HTML Injection is a vulnerability that occurs when unfiltered user input is displayed on the page.

When a user has control of how their input is displayed, they can submit HTML (or JavaScript) code, and the browser will use it on the page, allowing the user to control the page's appearance and functionality.
