# **Operating System Security**

The Operating System (OS) is the layer sitting between the hardware and the applications and programs you are running.

All the programs and applications cannot run directly on the computer hardware; however, they run on top of the operating system.

The operating system allows these programs to access the hardware according to specific rules.

- Confidentiality: You want to ensure that secret and private files and information are only available to intended persons.

- Integrity: It is crucial that no one can tamper with the files stored on your system or while being transferred on the network.

- Availability: You want your laptop or smartphone to be available to use anytime you decide to use it.

## **Authentication and Weak Passwords**

Authentication is the act of verifying your identity

Authentication can be achieved via three main ways:

- Something you know
- Something you are
- Something you have

Many users tend to use easy-to-guess passwords or the same password on many websites.

Moreover, some users rely on personal details such as date of birth and name of their pet, thinking that this is easy to remember and unknown to attackers.

However, attackers are aware of this tendency among users.

## **Weak File Permissions**

Proper security dictates the principle of least privilege or in simpler terms, “who can access what?”.

Weak file permissions make it easy for the adversary to attack confidentiality and integrity.

## **Access to Malicious Programs**

The last example we will consider is the case of malicious programs. Depending on the type of malicious program, it can attack confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## **Practical exemple**

`SSH` to establish a safe encrypted connexion between localcomputer and server.
