# **Introduction**

---

A Penetration test or pentest is an ethically-driven attempt to test and analyse the security defences to protect these assets and pieces of information.

A penetration test involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit.

## **Ethics**

Ethics is the moral debate between right and wrong; where an action may be legal, it may go against an individual's belief system of right and wrong.

Penetration testers will often be faced with potentially morally questionable decisions during a penetration test.

For example, they are gaining access to a database and being presented with potentially sensitive data.

If that action has been agreed upon during the initial stages, it is legal -- however *ethically questionable*.

| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| White hat | They remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others.                 |
| Grey hat  | They do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times.              |
| Black hat | Criminals that seek to damage organisations or gain some form of financial benefit |

### **Rules of engagment**

This document consists of three main sections, which are ultimately responsible for deciding how the engagement is carried out.

| Section    | Description                                                            |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Permission | Gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out.        |
| Test Scope | Specific targets to which the engagement should apply                  |
| Rules      | Define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement |

## **Methodologies**

The steps a penetration tester takes during an engagement is known as the methodology.

A practical methodology is a smart one, where the steps taken are relevant to the situation at hand.

### **General Methodology**

| Enumeration/Scanning  | Discovering applications and services running on the systems                                                                                                                                                   |
| Exploitation          | Leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application.                                                                                                                                              |
| Privilege Escalation  | Expand your access to a system.(horizontally and vertically)                                                                                                                                                   |

## **Scopes**

### **Black-Box Testing**

This testing process is a high-level process where the tester is not given any information about the inner workings of the application or service.

The tester acts as a regular user testing the functionality and interaction of the application or piece of software.

No knowledge of programming or understanding of the programme is necessary for this type of testing.

Black-Box testing significantly increases the amount of time spent during the information gathering and enumeration phase to understand the attack surface of the target.

### **Grey-Box Testing**

This testing process is the most popular for things such as penetration testing.

The tester will have some limited knowledge of the internal components of the application or piece of software.

Still, it will be interacting with the application as if it were a black-box scenario and then using their knowledge of the application to try and resolve issues as they find them.

With Grey-Box testing, the limited knowledge given saves time, and is often chosen for extremely well-hardened attack surfaces.

### **White-Box Testing**

With Grey-Box testing, the limited knowledge given saves time, and is often chosen for extremely well-hardened attack surfaces.

The tester will be testing the internal components of the application or piece of software.

The full knowledge in a White-Box testing scenario provides a testing approach that guarantees the entire attack surface can be validated.
