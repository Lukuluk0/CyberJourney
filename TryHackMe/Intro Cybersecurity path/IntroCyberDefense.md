# **Intro to Cyber Defense**

---

## **Introduction**

Defensive security is somewhat the opposite of offensive security, as it is concerned with two main tasks:

1. Preventing intrusions from occurring

2. Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly

## **Security Operations Center (SOC)**

A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events.

Some of the main areas of interest for a SOC are:

- Vulnerabilities

- Policy violations

- Unauthorized activity

- Network intrusions

### **Threat intelligence**

Threat intelligence aims to gather information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries. The purpose would be to achieve a *threat-informed defense*.

Intelligence needs data. Data has to be collected, processed, and analyzed. Data collection is done from local sources such as network logs and public sources such as forums.

Learning about your adversaries allows you to know their tactics, techniques, and procedures.

## **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)**

### **Digital Forensics**

Forensics is the application of science to investigate crimes and establish facts.

In defensive security, the focus of digital forensics shifts to *analyzing evidence* of an attack and its *perpetrators* and other areas such as intellectual property theft, cyber espionage, and possession of unauthorized content.

Digital forensics will focus on different areas such as:

- File System

- System memory

- System logs

- Network logs

### **Incident Response**

An incident usually refers to a data breach or cyber attack.

Incident response specifies the methodology that should be followed to handle such a case.

The four major phases of the incident response process are:

1. Preparation

2. Detection and Analysis

3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

4. Post-Incident Activity

### **Malware Analysis**

Malware stands for malicious software.

Malware includes many types, such as:

- Virus is a piece of code (part of a program) that attaches itself to a program.

- Trojan Horse is a program that shows one desirable function but hides a malicious function underneath.

- Ransomware is a malicious program that encrypts the userâ€™s files.
